# hotlite-launcher  
  
This version of the launcher is designed to swap jar files on the classpath.

Enabling you to use your own client builds with the RuneLite / Jagex launcher with ease.

Build the launcher using Maven install then replace the RuneLite.jar at %USER%\AppData\Local\RuneLite.  

hotlite was designed to fallback to RL in the event that a non snapshot update was released and you haven't exported that version yet.  
You will get a warning prompt in this case.
